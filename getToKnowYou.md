# Questions to assess where You are.

## Linux
1. Linux: can You use it? to what level?
2. Basic linux commands:  alias grep fgrep sed ls chmod cd find 
3. Text editors in Linux: what are Your preferred ones?
4. MarkDown documents: (.md extension) proficiency?  using MD editor (like Typora) ?
5. Installation of linux tools (especially VLSI CAD ones) ?
6. Linux zsh, bash, tcsh or none? 
7. Useful variables (setenv-s) : LD_LIBRARY_PATH, PATH, .... setenv vs set
8. Scripting languages and applications
9. Version control tools: open source, SOS, commercials.
10. Do You have linux on Your laptop?

## GIT
Are You:  Active user, Familiar, Over-the-shoulder
    1. git basics
    2. git tricks
    3. git frustrations


## Open Source Tools
Not enough designers are aware, did You met these?
1. iverilog
2. verilator
3. graphviz (dot)
4. gtkwave / dinotrace
5. yosys
6. openSTA
7. openRoad
8. draw.io 
9. wavedrom


## Commercials tools
You: Active use, Used long time ago, Familiar, Over-the-shoulder
1. Verilog simulator: Synopsys/Cadence/Mentor/Aldec
2. Synthesis: Synopsys/Cadence
3. static timing
4. linters
5. FPGA:  Altera/Xilinx/?
6. TCL scripting for these tools?
7. How deep these tools buried in EDA environments?

## Verilog
I can do these: Can/Did:
1.  write control module (State machines and such).
2.  write arithmetic module.
3.  write rom like module.
4.  integration of IPs.
5.  integration of whole chip, including IOs..
6.  configuration and generation of IP from cadence, synopsys or others.
7. Generated code by script. If yes, examples.
8. if You put code into open source(GitHub) - examples.
9. Downloaded verilog modules from open source.
10. build test bench and used it to debug modules.
11. did verification with SV-UVm or E-Verisity
12. Line Coverage and functional coverage
13. GateLevel simulation with or without SDF.
14. Mixed level simulation. if yes, What setup?
