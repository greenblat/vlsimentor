# Simulation
- Simulation is a run of verilog simulator , producing print outs (like **$display**) and waves file (**$dumpvars**).
- waves are in VCD format (Value Change Dump). It is a readable ascii format. 
All EDA companies invented their own binary formats to lock You in.

## Free available simulator
- ICARUS is downloadable open source simulator. the executable is called iverilog.
- GTKWAVE is waves viewer. There are others too.

## Simplest flow:

-    **iverilog -o tb.vvp  -g2012 tb.v upcounter.v**
    produces executable called tb.vvp   -g2012 is needed to allow all latest verilog language features.
    tb.vvp will not be produced when there are errors in the verilog code.
-    **vvp tb.vvp  -lver.log**   
    (run the simulation, and ver.log will be the log file)
-    **gtkwave dump.vcd**    
    examine the waves.

## Verification
 In the industry most popular verification language is **SystemVerilog + UVM**.  Two ugly cousins.
 Some dinosaurs wehemently keep "**E Specman**" alive. Beating a dead horse.
 Latetly there is talk about **Python** as verification language. At **IGreenblat LTD** we been using **Python** since 2004.

 **Python** invokes and controls the simulation, runs golden models and analyzes success / fail of tests. But that for later.
