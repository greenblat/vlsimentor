Damian mentioned Rage. As time passes , i noticed the list of VLSI design tools i dislike grows longer.
currently my top ten: AXI, VHDL, SV, UVM, SV+UVM, Commercial NOCs, some commercial IPs, encrypted IP, regFile generators.
Ok, don't count.

Invitation to SV-UVM advanced class makes me sick. Cost of military hardware written in VHDL causes me pay my taxes.
News about AXI4Stream/Lite/Snow make me watch rerun of Cernobyl episode (It feels so exact (the show) - and I was born in USSR - So maybe some details are not correct, but the big boom and the fear of Everything and the idea that We/Right/Left/.. can't be wrong ).

While list of likes is not growing - Linux, most things Apple, Verilog, Python, Python for design, C for speed - pretty steady for the last 20 years.
Back to my top ten..
I know it is just me and few dozens of likes i get for venting posts on Linkedin. But what about all the young minds poisoned by DeepState/Corporations/VHDL/UVM/..
Oopst! i am turning into S. Steshenko. better stop now, Have a nice weekend!
Just learned that a colleague from MSIL passed away. RIP Zvika! Perspective.
