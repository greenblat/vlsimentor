Musings on EDA tools for VLSI
VLSI design flow employs numerous tools. Once in a while a new tool is introduced. In the beginning it usually has one specific task. And it tries to do it well.

Over time, though, features are added to the core competency and the tool becomes bloated. Except making coffee it has it all. It aims to become an "environment". But worse than that is the core task becomes less visible and being less advanced over time.

Synthesis as example (or place&route) - it has myriad of flags, commands, tasks and what not. It takes an increasing effort just to synthesize something. Look at synth scripts - long and complicated.

With simulation, No exception, tools got wrapped over time with many add-ons. But the basic simulation didnâ€™t change much. All these crutches, aside from costing money, are just that - crutches.
Is this the one of the reasons for increasing cost of make tape-out?

And why i am telling You this? I have an idea about #simulation , tried to pitch it to Chipex23 ðŸ™‹, but it was not accepted ðŸ˜¥ .

Maybe next time âœŠ
