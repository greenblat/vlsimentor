Come and #work LIKE me.

My feed is flooded with “Come work with me/us/our great team” posts. Enticing pictures of company events, panoramic view from the 62nd floor, dogs in the office, “How i love my new job of 3weeks”, impressive catering pics, onboarding backpack with company logo, pens cups. HR folks engaging in mutual admiration societies.

On the other hand, when i talk to people working in the very same outfits, I get different impressions.

We all know that working for Apple/Intel/Google/Facebook/Meta/…. is just a continuous party -
Management by disasters. Long commutes to the office. Unrealistic deadlines. Terrible bosses. Meetings. Reports. Jiras without borders. Politics. Legacies. “We always done it this way”. “It is the industry standard”.
And there are startups too. Plenty of money without any idea what to do with it (company events, remember?) And this is just the tip of the titanic.

So humor me, i just propose an option. I don’t intend to hire You. Instead come and join working #freelance. You will give up company events. You will give up pep talks by Your CEO about his rosy future. You will have to find Your own charity and volunteer where You feel is important. You will book Your own vacations. You’ll choose Your own computer screen, laptop, bag, chair and table. You will have to be responsible. You will have to be nice to people. You will not be limited by ice cream flavors Your HR department chooses. You will have to buy Your own passover (or Xmas, or Ramadan or Devali or…) gifts. You will have to learn new stuff because it intrigues You. You will be able to visit just the offices where train / bicycle can take You.
And finally, Oh the terror - You could end up working alongside with me.

Now seriously - working alone is probably not the best choice for many. But so are those sugary posts about how great it is to be a cog in the machine. I wish You could refrain from posting those. You decided to spend Your valuable time at a new place - good for You, but look at Glassdoor too.
Or Take a moment and read Meadhbh Hamrick 's post on company He is working for - this is how it's done.
