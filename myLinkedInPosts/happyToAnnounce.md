Happy to announce i am starting new position at ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Did You fall for that? Really? You know i‚Äôll try to stay freelancer as long as i can. And these days mark 19 years that i can.
***Unless someone makes me an offer i can‚Äôt refuse **

However i did started something new: #design and #debug of #fpga . It is new to me. And as anyone doing this will soon see: FPGA is not ASIC in several subtle ways.

Navigating these treacherous waters - the moment when bunch of tiny green lights start blinking - is like finally spotting the lighthouse beacon in the night storm.
And it is not about Tape-out in the fourth quarter of 25 , it is now. Ok, not now, but in half an hour.

You would never guess , but I and UVM/VHDL/(stupider parts of SV) are not exactly buddies.
Not blindly bowing to ‚Äúindustry standards‚Äù is my comfort zone.
I can‚Äôt stand the vain complexity and plain bullheadedness of these ‚Äúinventions‚Äù.

So it comes natural that the FPGA i am playing with is not Altera/Xilinx, but EFINIX.
Imagine - WAZE points You to a road few know about. There are plenty of little efinixes it stock. And i cost me 500 shekels to get the development board from DigiKey.

The software is simple, has python API and I mastered the debugger in no time.  Heavy German accent of the introduction video sounds like Chef shares soup recipe. makes me smile every time. This video is to the point and every frame counts.  Support guy answered my couple emails. And today it all came together for my paying project. Screen of my trusty old Tektronix scope proves it.

Bottom line, Gitty - don‚Äôt say ‚ÄúIf it is not UVM - i am not coming‚Äù. It is always joy to discover new ideas - OpenSource tools, zeroAsic, analog computing, async logic, mesochronous, unknown vendors and bunch of other buzzs.

P.S. And if You know how to configure PLL in T20 - Pls help. I failed that till now.ü§∑
