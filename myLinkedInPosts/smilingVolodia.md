Just found this text in the basement:
Smiling Volodia

Volodia is a #verification expert. He used to work on #rtl modules i wrote.
Every morning, when i arrived at work and saw him in a smiling mood, it was because of bag full of fat juicy bugs He caught during that night.
It went for quite a while, but at some point plain hello replaced the grin.

Why i liked working with the guy, except for occasional vodka and vobla?
Because every bug was dissected with big red arrow pointing to the problem area. The guy understood the system, the why's and what's and was able explain the problem  in my own words. From my perspective.

Rostislav also had verified my modules. Different modules, different company, different drinks.
But the same attitude. Give me juicy bug on a platter. With fork stuck into the problem origin. Too graphic? my apologies, i tend to be carried away.

And why i miss these guys?
Because these days, most verificators are different. They come from different areas, are tought superfically SV/E UVM, but lack the the broad perspective. Have little idea about the design of chips and systems. Only few are willing to expand the horizons.

Many times i get an email with problem desription that goes like:
  "the VIP spurted out an error message at 10345729509ns. ..."
The message is cryptic and surrounded by tons of other cryptic messages. The waves - huge. The log file is looong and full of irrelevant ASCII characters.

I have no idea what the test attempted.  No idea of vicinity - like, were there correct comparisons before or after the error. Basically it boils down to system telling me:
  " Ilia - you have a bug, dare you to catch it. Maybe i know what it is, but i am not telling you".

For one, i know i have a bug. No need to rub it into my face.
So i take a deep breath and dive into the green/red waves.

What i really do about it? maybe in the next post, but yes, it involves #python and few other tricks.
