# CORDIC

cordic family of algorithms implement sinus, cosinus, sqrt, arctangen by iteration
without mulitpliers or dividers, by simple shifts and adds.
currently only sqrt is asked.
sinus/cosinus will appear at later date.

## SQRT
look at the C code and implement it in verilog.
the C code is taken from: https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~jhw/cordic/
s will be the result.

write implementation of this module and simple testbench to test it. 

- implementation can be either pipelined or "run-to-completion"
