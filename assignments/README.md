#Assignments
various level verilog exersizes.

some are simple, some are tricky.
the numbering order is almost random, as ideas came into my head.

write RTL, write testbench,  test it in real simulator. 
good luck.

my emai is greenblat@mac.com put there just the verilogs, i will take a look and comment. or through whatsup 054-4927322  Also there is no particular order to assignments. In all assignments,  please do best effort to fill undefined holes in specification by taking the most reasonable / simple path.

Every time You read specification of a new module, You will  notice undefined stuff, stuff that makes You ask questions. If there is "obvious" "reasonable" way to resolve it - take it and add a note.

Each assignment requires a design (module of verilog or hierarchy of them) and testbench to run the design. No one expects full verification, but test of basic functionality.
