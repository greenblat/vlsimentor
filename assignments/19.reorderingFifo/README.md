# reordering fifo

Like regular first-in-first-out but with reordering capabilities.


take a look at PDF for definition of the problem.
there is also dot-v file as ports definition.

good luck.

P.S. i need this module for real, and i just have done an implemention. 
If Yours is better (in Your opinion) let's talk. I being paid for this, so we can make a deal.
