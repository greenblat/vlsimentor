# vlsimentor
mentoring attempt at VLSI / Verilog / RTL / Fpga stuffs.

# Welcome to repository of knowledge transfer.
**My knowledge. Transfers to You.** 
**This is in attempt to build  such thing. Please ask questions and serve comments.**

The assignments here assume basic knowledge of verilog RTL. 
(RTL = register transfer level, aka synthesizable verilog).
(GLV = gate level verilog. aka netlist).
for excelent tutorials on basics: goto **https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Problem_sets**

This repository is updated. do **"git pull"** !
