# FPGA vs ASIC

this is **work in progress**

- **reset handling**.
    Design initialization
    Async vs Sync vs None.
- **timing : number of logic levels.**
    in FPGA much less logic levels acceptable. Pipeline everything.
- **multipliers, rams, roms**
    In FPGA most of the above will have inherent instance. For example, FPGAs these days have all built in onboard multipleirs. In ASIC ont the othe hand, all of the above are made of library cells or jard macros.
