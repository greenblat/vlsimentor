# Annotated code of module and testbench 
My idea on how finished assignment should look like.

- verilog module of divider 32 bits by 16 bits. result of 32 bits.
- testbench verilog that instances the divider and drives test cases.
- annotation of verilog constructs, especially where it is different from programming lanugages.
